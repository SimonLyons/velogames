```

The most popular rider by far was German sprinter `r rider_cost$Rider[1]` with six of us selecting the human hair commercial to do battle on  Italian roads.

### Top Ten Riders

But of course, picking riders on reputation and past performance was no guarantee of success in the first of the year's Grand Tours. The top ten highest scoring riders for the Giro, in order were:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

require(dplyr)
rider_scores_dplyr <- giro_table_master %>% 
  select(rider, stage, Tot) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  group_by(rider) %>% 
  summarise(sum(Tot)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`sum(Tot)`))
# View(rider_scores_dplyr)

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = rider_scores_dplyr[1:10, ], aes(x = factor(rider_scores_dplyr$rider[1:10]), y = rider_scores_dplyr$`sum(Tot)`[1:10])) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "pink") + scale_x_discrete(limits = rider_scores_dplyr$rider[1:10]) + xlab("Rider") + ylab("Score") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))


```


The top ten highest scoring riders for the Giro, based on Return on Investment were:

``` {r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

rider_value_dplyr <- giro_table_master %>% 
  mutate(ROI = Tot / Cost) %>% 
  select(rider, stage, ROI) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  group_by(rider) %>% 
  summarise(sum(ROI)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`sum(ROI)`))
# View(rider_value_dplyr)

ggplot(data = rider_value_dplyr[1:10, ], aes(x = factor(rider_value_dplyr$rider[1:10]), y = rider_value_dplyr$`sum(ROI)`[1:10])) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") + scale_x_discrete(limits = rider_value_dplyr$rider[1:10]) + xlab("Rider") + ylab("ROI") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

```

The ROI data is insightful in that it reveals which riders provided the best bang for buck. Although expensive picks such as Valverde ultimately proved good investments, the four teams backing diminutive Columbian Esteban Chaves and the three that picked Dutchman Steven Kruijswijk must have been cheering all the way to the Velocredit bank! Note - clearly the bargain pick at only 8 Velocredits was Diego Ulissi and the only team directeur savvy enough to select the lightweight Lampre rider enjoyed glory and fame with overall victory....


### Overall Team Performance

At the end of a tightly fought three week battle the Ferris Wheel took top step on the podium by a comfortable margin. However it required bonus point allocations on the final stage for Jeff's team to unseat Jamie's cheap legs who had taken the lead from Stage 1 and seemed destined for victory.

``` {r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# This dplyr subset looks at the total points for each
# team overall and lists them in descending order.
team_total <- giro_table_master %>% 
  group_by("Team" = team, "Directeur" = directeur) %>% 
  summarise(sum(Tot)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`sum(Tot)`)) %>% 
  rename("Total" = `sum(Tot)`)
# Display as neat table using 'kable' function
kable(team_total)

```


### Individual Stage Performance

The scores for each stage paint a picture of early success for the $10 Legs. Big totals on Stages 1, 3 and 6 in particular gave Jamie's squad a commanding buffer during the opening part of the tour. The other standout individual stage score was when Nibali and the Ferris Wheel stamped their mark on Stage 19.

``` {r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Team scores by stage
team_scores <- giro_table_master %>% 
  group_by(stage, team) %>% 
  summarise(sum(Tot)) %>% 
  arrange(stage, desc(`sum(Tot)`))
ggplot(data = team_scores, aes(x = stage, y = `sum(Tot)`)) + geom_line(aes(colour = team), size = 1.2) + labs(title ="Stage Score", x = "Stage", y = "Points") + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Cumulative team scores by stage
team_cu_scores <- giro_table_master %>% 
  group_by(stage, team) %>% 
  summarise(sum(Tot)) %>% 
  group_by(team) %>%
  mutate(cu_stage = cumsum(`sum(Tot)`))
# Determine final placings
final_placings <- team_cu_scores %>%
  filter(stage == 21) %>%
  select(team, cu_stage) %>%
  arrange(desc(cu_stage)) %>%
  select(team)
# as.list(final_placings)

# View(team_cu_scores)
# Plot cumulative team scores
ggplot(data = team_cu_scores, aes(x = stage, y = cu_stage, order = (team_cu_scores$team))) + geom_line(aes(colour = team), size = 1.2) + labs(title ="Cumulative Score", x = "Stage", y = "Points") + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

What is interesting is the diversity of top scoring riders for the teams that made our Giro podium. 

``` {r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# This dlplyr filter looks at the top 4 scoring riders from
# the three teams that made the podium.
team_cu_rider_scores <- giro_table_master %>% 
  group_by(team, rider) %>% 
  summarise("Rider Total" = sum(Tot)) %>% 
  filter(team %in% final_placings$team[1:3]) %>% 
  arrange(team, desc(`Rider Total`)) %>% 
  top_n(n = 4, wt = `Rider Total`) %>% 
  rename("Rider" = rider, "Team" = team)
kable(team_cu_rider_scores)

```

Two teams shared Steven Kruijswijk and two different teams shared Esteban Chaves, but the rest of the riders responsible for a big points haul were unique.

The bottom three teams all selected riders enjoying a successful Giro and associated large total points, but they just didn't have enough of them!

``` {r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# This dlplyr filter looks at the top 4 scoring riders from
# the three teams that made the podium.
team_bt_rider_scores <- giro_table_master %>% 
  group_by(team, rider) %>% 
  summarise("Rider Total" = sum(Tot)) %>% 
  filter(team %in% final_placings$team[9:7]) %>% 
  arrange(team, desc(`Rider Total`)) %>% 
  top_n(n = 4, wt = `Rider Total`) %>% 
  rename("Rider" = rider, "Team" = team)
# Display as neat table using 'kable'
kable(team_bt_rider_scores)
